# EctoExample

This example is for practising the Ecto Composable Queries.
Plan:

  * Following the `Ecto Query Composition` in ElixirSchool blog.
  * Seeding many posts and tags and authors (aka. Resources) with auto scripting at seed.exs! (random)
  * Should be pagination from begining at controller's index() - paging with 50 posts (10 posts per page!)
